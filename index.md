I am a postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Statistics, and Probabilistic Modeling and Reasoning. Many people knew about Reinforcement learning through AlphaGo, but what piqued my interest was the agents of [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/) defeated Dota2 Champion [OG](https://ogs.gg/). Dota2 is an extremely complex game, and I've put in 10,000 hours and still feel like I'm at a low level (even though I've surpassed 99% of players), so it was a huge shock when I watched OpenAI Five vs. OG. I never thought that AI could tactically outperform the best human players in such a complex task, so I became interested in this field. In addition, according to my personal understanding, AI is a huge branch of statistics/probability theory, so I also developed a broad interest in probability theory and statistics. After studying CS at the University of Waterloo, I went to the University of Edinburgh to study Statistics and Operations Research.  I learned about [Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pmr/21-22/), Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and more. Now I think I have a mathematical foundation and a strong interest in related fields, which is enough to support my Ph.D. study.
